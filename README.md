# dotfiles

This works for me, not always, but when it works, it makes my life easier. I use it to save the configurations of my day-to-day tools. It makes me conscious about what I add to my config files, and because of it, I work better or faster.

When I have to work on something challenging, and I'm stuck. I'm here sharpening knives instead of wandering on Tik Tok or YouTube. It makes me spend time learning and improving. It makes me move forward.

``` terminal
python install.py
```
