# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. They're not perfect, and they don't always work flawlessly, but when they do, they makes my life easier. I use this repository to store configurations for my everyday tools, helping me maintain awareness of what goes into my setup. As a result, I feel I work more efficiently and intentionally.

When facing a challenging task and feeling stuck, managing my dotfiles acts as a productive form of "sharpening knives." Rather than getting distracted by TikTok or YouTube, I spend my time refining configurations, learning, and improving my skills. It keeps me engaged, productive, and constantly moving forward.
